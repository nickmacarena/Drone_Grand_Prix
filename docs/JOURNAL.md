## 2026-03-25 to 2026-03-26 — Project Setup

- Created repo, added README and VQ1 tech specs PDF
- Set up PX4 SITL + Gazebo on macOS; build issues documented in LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md
- Built `connect.py` — confirmed MAVLink telemetry over UDP port 14550
- Chose port 14550 (GCS link) over 14540 — 14540 gets a different MAVLink component

## 2026-03-31 — Control Baseline + Pipeline Design

- Built `control.py` — arm, takeoff, NED position setpoints, land; confirmed drone moves in Gazebo
- Read tech spec carefully; decided not to target competition sim interface yet — focus on PX4 SITL for the next month while competition sim is unavailable
- Designed pipeline architecture and documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Created `docs/` folder structure
